## Prototype 
Figma was use to create the prototype. There were main two(2) desig options. Option 1 was approved during the option selection review sprint.

**Reason for Creating the App**

Enhancing search capabilities for train line information addresses the shortcomings of current tools, which often lack flexibility and comprehensive functionality. This application provides a modern and intuitive solution to these challenges, offering the following benefits:
*  Improved Efficiency: By using advanced search capabilities and real-time data, users can access relevant train line information in seconds.
*  Increased Accuracy: With live updates from trusted APIs, the data is always current, eliminating outdated or incomplete results.
*  User-Friendly Design: By introducing a search function and organizing train line data alphabetically (A-Z), the application offers a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. Users can easily navigate and locate specific information without scrolling through long, cumbersome tables, making the process faster and more efficient.

### Project Management
For the Train Line Information Search Application, an incremental linear approach was employed using GitHub Projects to streamline development. This structured methodology involved upfront requirements gathering, incremental feature development, and rigorous testing of each component before progression. Visual task tracking through a Kanban board facilitated risk management and error detection, enabling quicker delivery of functional prototypes and simplified testing of smaller, manageable increments. The combination of structured workflows and iterative refinement ensured the effective and collaborative development of the application while maintaining flexibility for enhancements.
